# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

#### The purpose of this project was to visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

![Theater Outcomes by Launch Date](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88937178/130381888-ee02a2e1-2c1e-4ff8-8cac-0c7f1e57db0a.png)

#### This chart shows the success of theater fundraising campaigns based on their launch date. The x-axis shows the months out of the year and the y-axis shows the number of campaigns that were launches in the given month. The campaigns are divided based on their outcome status - successful, failed or cancelled - and their growth can be observed by looked at their corrosponding line on the chart. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

#### This graph shows the success of theater fundraising campaigns, specifically for plays, based on their fundraising goal. Depending on the monetary range, represented by the x-axis, your campaign had a certain likelihood of being a successful, failed or canceled campaign - this percentage is represented on the y-axis.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

#### Some potential challenges or places for error could be typos when inputting the formulas and not knowing how to remove certain pieces of data from a data set that you don't want to represent in a chart.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
#### Taking a look at the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date we can make at least two observations that will be important for Louise to know. (1) Most successful theater fundraising campaigns are launched in May. The launch date could be a factor in increasing the likelihood of success in a fundraising campaign, so Louise would be best of launching her campaign in May or even June. (2) While there are not more failed campaigns in December than at other times of the year, there are fewer successful campaigns. The holiday season could make it harder to get the attention of donors, making the number of successful campaigns almost equal to the number of failed ones.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
#### A fundraising campaign has the highest likelihood of being a success of the goal is less than $1,000. After that the rate of success declines before shooting back up between the $35,000-$45,000 range.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
#### This dataset only shows us the crowdfunding data from Kickstarter. It does not draw from other online crowdfunding platforms so we do not have the whole picture in regards to fundraising campaigns for theaters and plays. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
#### The rate of successful campaigns over the years - it would be useful to know whether giving is increasing, decreasing or staying steady. It could be helpful to inform Louise's fundraising strategy and see if a Kickstarter campaign is really the best method and platform for her. Another useful table would show the fundraising goal for successful campaigns and what the average amount donated was. This would be useful for Louise to see how much she should be aiming for her donors to give in order to have a successful campaign.
